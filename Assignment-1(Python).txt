## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ANS1. 	Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ANS2. 	Because the type is determined during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
ANS3. 	Pros - 	It's Simple
				It's Free
				It's Easy to Use
				It's Highly Compatible 
				It is Object-Oriented
				It has Lots of Libraries
				It has Built-in Data Structures
				It's Widely Applicable
				It Increases Speed and Productivity
				It's Easy to Learn 
		Cons - 
				Poor Memory Efficiency
				Slow Speed
				Database Access
				Weak in Mobile Computing
				Runtime Errors
				 

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
ANS4. 	developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization, artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ANS5. 	Variables are containers for storing data values.
		In other prog. lan. a variable's type has to be specified before it may be assigned to a value. This process is called variable declaration. 
		But in Python, we don't declare variables, we simply assign them. In short, we can think of a variable in Python as a name for an object.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
ANS6. 	a=input() and it always have string datatype

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ANS7. 	input() fundction have default string datatype

Q8. What is type casting?
ANS8. 	Changing the variable datatype to other datatype.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
ANS9. 	a.b=input().split()

Q10. What are keywords?
ANS10.	Keywords in Python are unique reserved words that cannot use a keyword as a variable, function, or other identifiers. 
		These special words are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
ANS11. 	No, we can not use keywords as a variable because it is already reserved.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
ANS12. 	Spaces at the beginning of a code line

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
ANS13.	by print() function

Q14. What are operators in Python?
ANS14.	Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
ANS15. 	/ - division
		// - Floor Division (digit after the decimal is removed)

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
ANS16.	print("iNeuron"*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
ANS17. a=int(input("Enter the number which we want to check even or odd??"))
		if a%2==0:
			print("Even")
		else :
			print("Odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
ANS18. Boolean Operators are those that result in the Boolean values of True and False. 
These include and, or and not. While and & or require 2 operands, not is a unary operator.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
ANS19.
```
1 or 0 --> 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
		if.
		if..else.
		Nested if.
		if-elif statements.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
ANS21. The if…elif…else statement is used in Python for decision making

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
ANS22.	a=int(input("Enter the age of person"))
		if a>=18:
			print("I can vote")
		else :
			print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
ANS23. 	numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
		a=0
		for i in numbers:
			if i%2==0:
				a=a+i
		print(a)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
ANS24. 	a=[]
		for i in range(1,4):
			a.append(int(input()))
		print("largest number among the three input number is ",max(a))

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
ANS25. 	a=[]
		numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
		for i in numbers:
			if i%5==0:
				if i>150 and i<501:
					continue
				elif i>500:
					break
				else:
					a.append(i)
		print(a)
